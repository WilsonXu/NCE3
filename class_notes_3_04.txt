Text
These days, people who do manual work often receive far more money than people who work in offices. People who work in offices are frequently referred to as ‘white-collar workers’ for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work. Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar works. This can give rise to curious situations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for Ellesmere Corporation.
